fails:Basic assignment allows the assignment of the rhs to the lhs using the lhs splat operator
fails:Basic assignment supports the {|r,| } form of block assignment
fails:Basic assignment allows assignment through lambda
fails:Assignment using expansion succeeds without conversion
fails:Basic multiple assignment with a single RHS value does not call #to_a on an Array instance
fails:Basic multiple assignment with a single RHS value does not call #to_a on an Array subclass instance
fails:Basic multiple assignment with a single RHS value calls #to_ary on an object
fails:Basic multiple assignment with a single RHS value does not call #to_a on an object if #to_ary is not defined
fails:Basic multiple assignment with a splatted single RHS value calls #to_a on an object if #to_ary is not defined
fails:Basic multiple assignment with a splatted single RHS value calls #to_ary on an object
fails:Basic multiple assignment with a splatted single RHS value calls #to_a on a String
fails:Assigning multiple values evaluates rhs left-to-right
fails:Assigning multiple values calls #to_ary on rhs arg if rhs has only a single arg
fails:Assigning multiple values allows complex parallel assignment
fails:Conditional assignment checks for class variable definition before fetching its value
fails:Unconditional operator assignment 'obj.meth op= expr' is equivalent to 'obj.meth = obj.meth op expr'
fails:Conditional operator assignment 'obj.meth op= expr' may not assign at all, depending on the truthiness of lhs
fails:Operator assignment 'obj.meth op= expr' evaluates lhs one time
fails:Unconditional operator assignment 'obj[idx] op= expr' is equivalent to 'obj[idx] = obj[idx] op expr'
fails:Conditional operator assignment 'obj[idx] op= expr' may not assign at all, depending on the truthiness of lhs
fails:Operator assignment 'obj[idx] op= expr' handles complex index (idx) arguments
fails:Operator assignment 'obj[idx] op= expr' returns result of rhs not result of []=
fails:Single assignment If rhs has multiple arguments, lhs becomes an Array of them
fails:Multiple assignments with splats * on the lhs has to be applied to the last parameter
fails:Multiple assignments with splats * on the LHS returns the Array on the RHS enclosed in an Array
fails:Multiple assignments with grouping rhs cannot use parameter grouping, it is a syntax error
